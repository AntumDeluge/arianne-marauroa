Marauroa
--------

Marauroa is a implementation, using Java, of Arianne, but we are also 
extending some of the concepts implemented in Arianne to improve it.

Marauroa wants to be a multiplayer role playing game that you can access
through your internet connection. It is a virtual world, and you have
an unprecedented degree of freedom to shape your own destiny. Social 
interaction, combat, or just hanging out with friends will all be parts of 
your experience.

Marauroa is also a Multiplayer Onlince Engine, that you can use to build 
you own online games using Marauroa as a Content Management system.

Marauroa is completly written in Java using a multithreaded server architecture
with a UDP oriented network protocol, a mySQL based persistence engine and a 
flexible game system based on open systems totally expandible and modifiable 
by developers and that is able to run scripts on Python for the game's rules.
 
Marauroa is based on a philosophy we called Action/Perception, on each turn a 
perception is send to clients explaining them what they percieve and clients 
can ask server to do any action in their names using actions.
Marauroa is totally game agnostic and makes very little assumptions about what 
are you trying to do, allowing a great freedom to create whatever type of game 
you want.
Bugs are facts of life, they just happen. But Arianne is fully tested using 
Test Units with JUnit and cppunit, so all modules are tested for most common 
cases, allowing a better quality software to be deployed. Your cooperation 
reporting problems is simply invaluable: You are our best developer and we want
to read from you.

You can find the latest version of Marauroa at: 
http://marauroa.sourceforge.net

Marauroa is a GPL project.

Version
-------
0.33 version 


Status
------
Marauroa is playable.

Version >0.11 contains a very simple game: Tic-tac-toe, implemented 
using the Marauroa engine.

Version >0.20 contains a simple Gladiators game using also the Marauroa engine.
You need arianne's Gladiator client in order to be able to play.

Version >0.33 contains a multiplayer pacman game using the Python rules.


Requirements
------------
Actually to compile Marauroa you need:
- Java SDK 1.4.2	( http://java.sun.com )
- JUnit 1.3.8		( http://junit.sourceforge.net )
- Ant 1.5.4			( http://ant.apache.org )

In order to get it working with MySQL you also need:
- MySQL Connector/J ( http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-stable.html )


Build
-----
You need ant properly installed on your system to build Marauroa.
Once you have ant running, simple move to marauroa directory and run ant.
Before running ant you need to edit build.xml in Marauroa to point to correct 
Junit.jar file.

  <property name="junitlib" value="../../../classes/junit.jar"/>

Also if you want to use JDBC MySQL database please, modify also build.xml
 
  <property name="connectorJ" value="../../../classes/mysql-connector-java-3.0.9-stable-bin.jar"/>


Then save and run ant.

cd /foo/bar/marauroa
ant jar

You will have a marauroa-<version>.jar file in the lib folder.


Running
-------
Use the BAT files to run it:
- marauroad [-c configurationFile] is the server 
- JMarauroa is the client

Edit marauroad.ini to use JDBC Database.
Please refer to docs/JDBC Database HOWTO.txt

Read simpleGame/README about how to play it.
Read the1001/README about how to run Gladiators
