Marauroa
--------

Marauroa is a Multiplayer Online Engine Server, that you can use to build 
you own online games using Marauroa as a Content Management system.

Marauroa is completly written in Java using a multithreaded server architecture
with a UDP oriented network protocol, a mySQL based persistence engine and a 
flexible game system based on open systems totally expandible and modifiable 
by developers and that is able to run scripts on Python for the game's rules.
 
Marauroa is based on a philosophy we called Action/Perception, on each turn a 
perception is send to clients explaining them what they percieve and clients 
can ask server to do any action in their names using actions.
Marauroa is totally game agnostic and makes very little assumptions about what 
are you trying to do, allowing a great freedom to create whatever type of game 
you want.
Bugs are facts of life, they just happen. But Arianne is fully tested using 
Test Units with JUnit and cppunit, so all modules are tested for most common 
cases, allowing a better quality software to be deployed. Your cooperation 
reporting problems is simply invaluable: You are our best developer and we want
to read from you.

You can find the latest version of Marauroa at: 
http://arianne.sourceforge.net

Marauroa is a GPL project.

Version
-------
0.36 version 


Status
------
Marauroa is playable.

Version >0.11 contains a very simple game: Tic-tac-toe, implemented 
using the Marauroa engine. It was removed on 0.35

Version >0.20 contains a simple Gladiators game using also the Marauroa engine.
You need arianne's Gladiator client in order to be able to play.

Version >0.33 contains a multiplayer pacman game using the Python rules.


Requeriments
------------
Actually to compile Marauroa you need:
- Java SDK 1.4 http://java.sun.com
- JUnit 1.3.8 http://junit.sourceforge.net
- Ant 1.6 http://ant.apache.org

In order to get it working with MySQL you also need:
- MySQL Connector/J http://www.mysql.com/downloads/api-jdbc-stable.html

Optionally you may want to add the next set of libraries:
- Jython 2.1 http://www.jython.org/download.html

And optionally if you want to build the java 3D gladiators client:
- JOrbis 0.0.12 http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis/
- Quake 2 MD2 Loader http://www.newdawnsoftware.com/resources/j3d.html
- Loader3DS http://www.starfireresearch.com/services/java3d/inspector3ds.html

Build
-----
Build using ant

You need ant properly installed on your system to build Marauroa. Once you have
ant running, simple move to marauroa directory and run ant. 

cd /foo/bar/marauroa ant -Dlibdir=./dependencies jar

Where dependencies is a directory that contains all the libraries, you can omit 
it if you have configured correctly your classpath.

You will have a marauroa-<version>.jar file in the lib folder. You can generate
all the documentation by doing ant docs

Running
-------
ok, you have compiled Marauroa and now what to do?

BUILD SUCCESSFUL Total time: 3 seconds

Nice, isn't it? Well, if you have build a Marauroa server it is because you 
want to play yourself with the server because either you want to run your own
 game server or because you are a developer wanting to develop your own game. 
If you don't understand the above it is prone that you are looking for 
http://arianne.sourceforge.net instead.

- Configuration
Once we have build Arianne the next step is to setup the configuration file.
Each game features a configuration file that will configure the server to run
that particular game.

# Please don't remove. Needed for test cases.
test_ATestString=ATestString

# The database type
# Options are:
#   - MemoryPlayerDatabase
#   - JDCBPlayerDatabase
marauroa_DATABASE=MemoryPlayerDatabase

# JDBC Database configuration
jdbc_url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1/marauroa
jdbc_class=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
jdbc_user=marauroa_dbuser
jdbc_pwd=marauroa_dbpwd

# Network configuration of Marauroa
marauroa_PORT=3214

# RP Configuration ( This is provisional )
rp_RPZoneClass=marauroa.game.MarauroaRPZone
rp_RPRuleProcessorClass=marauroa.game.MarauroaRPRuleProcessor
rp_turnDuration=60000

# Server related configuration
# Types of game are:
#   - marauroa
#   - simplegame
#   - the1001
# Changes should be related to rp_RPZoneClass and rp_RPRuleProcessorClass
server_typeGame=marauroa

server_name=Marauroa jserver
server_version=@version@
server_contact=https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=514826&group_id=66537&func=browse

# Place where Statistics and server activity report are generated.
server_stats_directory=~/public_html
server_logs_directory=~/.marauroa

Let see each section invidually. 

Database

Our first item is marauroa_DATABASE, this attribute set the type of database 
that you will use:
MemoryPlayerDatabase, this type of database is prebuilt in memory and so to 
modify it you need to recompile server and manually edit sources to add new 
accounts. Obviously when application is shut down everything modified is 
discarted.
JDBCPlayerDatabase, this is mainly a MySQL database. It won't run as-is on 
other SQL compliant database because it uses MySQL features as special tables
types to get transactions and auto_increment column types to generate pk.

My recomendation is that you should embrace MySQL and choose JDBCPlayerDatabase.

The next section describe the connection string to the database.
jdbc_url=jdbc:mysql://127.0.0.1/marauroa
This attribute explain where the database is running (127.0.0.1)_and that is 
the name of the database (marauroa).
jdbc_class=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver 
the class that describe the driver used for this JDBC connection
jdbc_user=marauroa_dbuser 
username of the database account for marauroa
jdbc_pwd=marauroa_dbpwd 
password of the database account for marauroa

Remember that to setup the database you need to enter into MySQL as 
administrator and run: 

  create database marauroa; 
  grant all on marauroa.* to marauroa_dbuser@<serverip> identified by 'marauroa_dbpwd';

The marauroa_PORT section defines in which TCP/IP port it will run. All the 
traffic of Marauroa is UDP based.

The next section talks about the Role playing engine configuration:
rp_RPZoneClass points to the class that contains our game RPZone logic
rp_RPRuleProcessorClass points to the class that contains our game 
RPRuleProcessor logic
rp_turnDuration defines the turn time. The lower the turn time the more 
bandwidth is prone to be used.

The available games actually now are:
the1001
mapacman

It should be set at server_typeGame

The server section contains information that will be sent the clients using the
Server info message, so whatever that begins with server_ is sent on that 
message to clients.

Finally you should define where the output of statistics and logs messages 
should be done:
server_stats_directory defines the folder where the statistics files are 
generated, usually a public HTML folder.
server_logs_directory defines where to store the logs. Please keep this one safe

- Running
Once you have it configured just run the server by doing

  java -classpath marauroa.jar;mysql-connector-java-3.0.7-stable-bin.jar marauroa.marauroad -c <game.ini> -l

This will make the server to start
Creating accounts

Before anything else happens you MUST create accounts for your players. The idea
is simple enough to you can even wrap it with a webpage much like we did with 
http://gladiators.game-server.cc

<game>.<game>createaccount -u <user> -p <password> -c <character> -e <email>

For example in mapacman
mapacman.mapacmancreateaccount -u root -p pazzw0rd -c MaSSive -e root@localhost.com

Each game has a different number of parameters, check it with the -h parameter.
Testing

To test that you connection is working use nullClient. It is a simple client 
that connect to server, choose character and receive perceptions. Just that, if
it works it means that everything else is also working.

  java -classpath marauroa.jar marauroa.nullClient -u root -p pazzw0rd -c MaSSive

Playing with clients
