As you have read in How Perceptions and Actions works, each Object include the 
attributes that are result of the action execution. So for each action we will
have:

Action Talk
The attributes added to the object are:
- action_talk_text

The action_talk_text contains the text the character has been asked to say.
This action is always one turn only, and can never fail.


Action Move
The attributes added to the object are:
- action_move_destination
- action_move_speed
- action_move_status

The action_move_destination is the place where the object wants to go when the 
action ends, and it is as before a Position denoted by <x,y>, action_move_speed
is the assigned speed for the character by the RP. The action_move_status denotes
if the action is complete, incompleted or failed.
This action is completed when position==destination and fail if destination is 
unreachable.


Action Get
The attributes added to the object are:
- action_get_status

The action_get_status denotes if the action is complete or failed
This action is always one turn long.


Action Release
The attributes added to the object are:
- action_release_status

The action_release_status denotes if the action is complete or failed
This action is always one turn long.


Action Use
The attributes added to the object are:
- action_use_status
- (Specific attributes depending on the object)

The action_use_status denotes if the action is complete, incompleted or failed.
Usually this action modify attributes of the RPObject instead of adding new 
attributes.


Action UseWith
The attributes added to the object are:
- action_usewith_status
- (Specific attributes depending on the object)

The action_usewith_status denotes if the action is complete, incompleted or failed.
Usually this action modify attributes of the RPObject instead of adding new 
attributes.


Action Exchange
The attributes added to the object are:
- action_exchange_status
- action_exchange_timeout

The action_exchange_status denotes if the action is complete, incomplete or failed.
This action last several turns until both peers accept or the timeout elapses.

On every object that executed an action you will have an status_<action_id>=<status>
that explain what happened with the action.
