As you have read in How Perceptions and Actions works, each Object include the 
attributes that are result of the action execution. So for each action we will
have:

Action Talk
The attributes added to the object are:
- action_talk_text

The action_talk_text contains the text the character has been asked to say.
This action is always one turn only, and can never fail.


Action Move
The attributes added to the object are:
- action_move_destination
- action_move_speed
- action_move_status

The action_move_destination is the place where the object wants to go when the 
action ends, and it is as before a Position denoted by <x,y>, action_move_speed
is the assigned speed for the character by the RP. The action_move_status denotes
if the action is complete, incompleted or failed.
