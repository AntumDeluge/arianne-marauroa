Classes of Objects are the basic way of structuring Marauroa data structures.

A class defines types of the attributes and its visibility and gives it an
internal code that is used to speed up searchs and save bandwidth.
You can base a class on another, this feature is known as heritance.

The data types available are:
- Strings
- Short strings ( up to 255 bytes )
- Integers ( 4 bytes )
- Shorts ( 2 bytes )
- Byte ( 1 byte )
- Flag ( it is a binary attribute )

Attributes can also be visible if clients see them when they change, or 
invisible if clients can't see them.
