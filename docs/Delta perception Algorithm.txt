The main idea behind the DPA is not to sent ALL the objects to client, but
only those that has been modified.

Imagine that we have 1000 objects, and only O1 and O505 are active objects that
are modified each turn. ok?

Traditional method:
	- Get objects that our player should see ( 1000 objects )
	- Send them to player ( 1000 objects )
	- Next turn 
	- Get objects that our player should see ( 1000 objects )
	- Send them to player
	- Next turn 
	...
	
I hope you see the problem..., we are sending again objects that never changed.

The delta perception algorithm:
	- Get objects that our player should see ( 1000 objects )
	- Reduce the list to the modified ones ( 1000 objects )
	- Store also the objects that are not longer visible ( 0 objects )
	- Send them to player ( 1000 objects )
	- Next turn 
	- Get objects that our player should see ( 1000 objects )
	- Reduce the list to the modified ones ( 2 objects )
	- Store also the objects that are not longer visible ( 0 objects )
	- Send them to player ( 2 objects )
	- Next turn 
	...
