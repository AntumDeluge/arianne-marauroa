The format of the output should at least include:
- Date and time
- Location of the error
- Explanation of the error
- Resolution adopted.

For the output we should consider to use a feature like syslogd.

Marauroa generate events and messages

Message events are generated by system or user code in response to system 
events occurring in the application server environment. They are always 
collected. You can decide whether to look at them. 

Message events include: 
- audit
	Indicates a significant event that must be recorded.

- warning
	Indicates that a problem has occurred that must be fixed to prevent a more
 	serious problem

- terminate
	Indicates that a process has terminated normally (a 0 is returned to the 
	shell).

- fatal
	Indicates that a process has encountered a fatal error and has terminated 
	abnormally.
	
Trace events are generated by system or user code. They are collected only if 
you specify to collect them. 
- entry
	Indicates that a process has entered a method.

- exit
	Indicates that a process has exited a method.

- debug
	Provides information for debugging purposes.

- event
	Indicates that a significant event took place, such as a state change.
	
To apply this to traces we have get a short name for each message or event type.
- ! is audit
- W is warning
- T is terminate
- F is fatal
- > is entry
- < is exit
- D is debug
- E is event

Traces must contain the entry and exit events always, so we can really trace what
the application is exactly doing. Even when we exit the procedure using an exception.
