Actions are sent from client to server in order to make their character to do
an action. In order for the client to know the result of the action Server need
to send it to client. How?

On a first try, we used to send client back an action that was the result, but
make code really hard because we had to update to different things, perceptions
and actions, so the idea appeared intuitively: Why not join action reply and 
perceptions.

So the action reply is stored inside each object ( that executed the action ) 
with a set of attributes that determine the action return status and the 
attributes. This way of working make a bit harder to RPManager but it simplify
a lot the creation of new clients.

See Actions reply in Objects document to know exactly what is returned.
