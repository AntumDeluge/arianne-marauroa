%% BEGIN %%
JDBC technology is an API that lets you access virtually any tabular data 
source from the Java programming language. It provides cross-DBMS connectivity
to a wide range of SQL databases, and now, with the new JDBC API, it also 
provides access to other tabular data sources, such as spreadsheets or flat files.

To configure Marauroa to work with a JDBC source we need to modify the 
configuration of the JDBC Connection.

So open marauroad.ini file and edit the next fields

    jdbc_class=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
    jdbc_url=jdbc:mysql://localhost/marauroa
    jdbc_user=marauroa_dbuser
    jdbc_pwd=marauroa_dbpwd

jdbc_class is the field that says what Driver to use. Please refer to your sofware
manual to see the multiple options.

jdbc_url points to the type and source of the information, for MySQL the string 
must be as follow:
	
	jdbc:mysql://<hostname>[:<port>]/<database name>
	
jdbc_user is the username for the database and jdbc_pwd is the password for that 
username in the database.

Then simply save the changes and ready.


Before using the application with the database, you need to create the database itself.
So in case of MySQL just open MySQL and write:

	create database marauroa;
	grant all on marauroa.* to marauroa_dbuser@localhost identified by 'marauroa_dbpwd';
	
The rest of code is handled by the server itself, that will create the tables if they 
don't exits.
