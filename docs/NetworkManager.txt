NetworkManager is our router that send and recieve messages from and to the 
network.<p>

The basic idea is that the manager expose and interface that allow:<ul>
<li>Read a message from the network</li>
<li>Send a message to the network</li>
<li>Finalize the manager</li>
</ul>

The read operation is a blocking one so it we have two options:<ul>
<li>Polling </li>
<li>Blocking</li>
</ul>

We choose blocking because we don't waste CPU time polling the network for 
messages, so we need to create a Thread to read from the Network, let's call
it NetworkManagerRead <p>

Alternatively, we have to write messages to the network, and write is an 
operation that is non blocking, so we safely can code it as a method of 
NetworkManager.<p>

NetworkManager must also open a Socket where it will recieve all the message 
from the network, and where it will write all the message to the network, both 
write and read use the same socket.<p>

With the idea of encapsulating all the information, we create both Read and 
Write methods as inner classes of NetworkManager, with the only difference that
Read extends Thread and Write is just a common class.<p>

<pre>
NetworkManager
  {
  socket
  messages
  
  NetworkManagerRead isa Thread
    {
    read socket
    build message
    store in messages
    }

  NetworkManagerWrite
    {
    build UDP from message
    send socket    
    }
  }
</pre>

As you can see messages are stored on a list when they are recieved, acccess to
the list is synchronized.<p>

So getting back to the interface exposed to other objects.<p>

The write method is inmediate, just call write with the message to send making 
sure that you have correctly filled SourceAddress and ClientID and it will be 
send to the client, it is important to notice that as the transport is based on 
UDP there are no guarantees that the message is correctly send, this situation 
is addresses in the protocol itself.<p>

The read method is blocking, when you call the read method it returns a message 
from the queue or blocks until one arrives if the queue is empty.<p>
