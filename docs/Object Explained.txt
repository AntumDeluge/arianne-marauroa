Objects are the basic Marauroa data structure, and you should already be
familiarized with it because you read Actions and Object document.

So let's point the multiple objects that we are going to have in Marauroa 
and their attributes and slots.

Avatar
The avatar is the entity in Marauroa that represent our character and it is the
way of handling everything in that world.
This object must have the next set of attributes:
- object_id				
- object_type		
- object_look		
- object_position
- object_name

Also add too the RP attributes that are still to be defined.
The object_id attribute define the unique identifier of the object in the world.
The object_type define the type of object it is, for example: human.
The object_look would point to the model used to represent this object.
The object_position determine where the object is in the world using a X,Y basis
Again, we could add the Z value, but it is totally fake, we calculate Z for 
adjusting character to terrain.
The object_name is just the name of the character this object is representing.


Stone
A stone is just a little rock used for testing get, release and exchange actions.
This object must have the next set of attributes:
- object_id				
- object_type		
- object_look		
- object_position

The object_id attribute define the unique identifier of the object in the world.
The object_type define the type of object it is, for example: stone.
The object_look would point to the model used to represent this object.
The object_position determine where the object is in the world using a X,Y basis
Again, we could add the Z value, but it is totally fake, we calculate Z for 
adjusting character to terrain.
