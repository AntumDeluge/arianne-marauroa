Objects are the basic Marauroa data structure, and you should already be
familiarized with it because you read Actions and Object document.

So let's point the multiple objects that we are going to have in Marauroa 
and their attributes and slots.
Most object share a few attributes. They are:
- object_id				
- object_type		
- object_look		
- object_position

The object_id attribute define the unique identifier of the object in the world.
The object_type define the type of object it is, for example: human.
The object_look would point to the model used to represent this object.
The object_position determine where the object is in the world using a X,Y basis
Again, we could add the Z value, but it is totally fake, we calculate Z for 
adjusting character to terrain.


Object Avatar
The avatar is the entity in Marauroa that represent our character and it is the
way of handling everything in that world.
This object must have also the next set of attributes:
- object_name

Also add too the RP attributes that are still to be defined.
The object_name is just the name of the character this object is representing.
The object has the next slots:
- left_hand
- right_hand
- backpack


Object Stone
A stone is just a little rock used for testing get, release and exchange actions.


Object Torch
A torch is a small piece of wood in form of stick that is used to light on the 
near area.
This object must have the next set of attributes:
- object_status

The object_status define if the torch is ON or OFF.


Object Chest
A wooden box with a lock that can be open or closed and can contain items inside.
This object must have the next set of attributes:
- object_status
- object_forkey

The object_status define if the chest is OPEN or CLOSED.
The object_forkey define the identifier of the key that opens this lock.
The object has the next slots:
