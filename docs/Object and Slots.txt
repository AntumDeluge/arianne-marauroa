As you know Objects can contain inside another object much like you have the
keys inside your pocket. The goal of Slots is to provide a richer gameplay 
while reducing the number of object in the zone.

To have these objects inside, we need our hoster object to have slots to place
them. One slot can only handle one single object.

For example a avatar can have:
- left hand
- right hand
- backpack
- left pocket
- right pocket

and we can store objects on these slots.
