The goal of RP Manager is to handle the whole RP game.
This means mainly:
- run RPActions from clients
- manage RPWorld
- control triggers for events
- control AI

As you see this is a HUGE class that is complex.
So the idea is to split this behaviour into smaller subclasses.

RPManager provides a simple interface to the GameManager for using it:
- addRPAction
- addRPObject
- removeRPObject
- hasRPObject

addRPAction simply enqueue an action for that player to be executed on the
next turn.

addRPObject, removeRPObject and hasRPObject is a interface to manage RPWorld.


The main outline of RPManager could be:

forever
  {
  Procced through every action in this turn
  Build Perception
  Remove timedout players
  
  Wait for Turn completion.
  Go to Next Turn
  }

As this part of Marauroa is subject still to development, there are still not 
many details.

RPScheduler is the class that handle actions to be enqueued for each player.
All the complexity of Action management should be handle here.

RuleProcessor is a wrapper class for hide actions code.
All the actions code MUST be here, this class also acts as a Action code loader,
as some actions are not part of Marauroa, but scripts.
