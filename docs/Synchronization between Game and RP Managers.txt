The idea is that they request to a central mutex access to the 
PlayerEntryContainer, and that mutex is the one that decide how the access is 
done.

We need to diference between two types of accesses, read access and write access.
We can have without problems two readers accessing in parallel, but we can only
have one write at the same time modifying the stuff.

Whatever action we choose in GameManager they are Write actions, as the modify the 
state of the PlayerContainer, but in RP we have two parts, one that build the perceptions
that is read only and one that remove idle players that is write, so we must apply two 
different locks there.
