The problem araise when we need to have two versions of Marauroa on the same 
machine. This happens when you run a release version and a development version
on the same machine.

So to avoid port collisions we will use different ports for each release.
The release version will run on the standard game port
The development version will run on the (standard game port)*10

For example:
release version of gladiators runs at 3214
development version runs at 32140

To allow different servers of Marauroa to run on the same machine running 
different games we will assign an unique port number to each game.

gladiators runs at 3214
mapacman runs at 3215
