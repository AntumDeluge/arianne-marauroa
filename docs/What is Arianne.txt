Arianne is a multiplayer online games framework and engine to develop turn
based and real time style games. It features a simple way of creating your
games on our portable, robust server architecture, that runs on Java using
Python for writting your games, that is powered by a mySQL backend to 
communicate with dozens of players using an UDP transport channel.Our 
reference clients are coded using Java and C language in order to achieve 
maximum portability.

Arianne has been in development since 1999 and it has evolved from a tiny 
application written in pseudo-C++ to a powerful, expandible server framework 
running on the Java platform and a portable client framework written in bare 
C to allow total portability of arianne's clients. Arianne's server is totally 
client agnostic. But since 1999, the key concept at Arianne has been 
KISS: Keep it simple, stupid. Our achieved goals are: simple, small, fast.

Arianne has been since the begin an Open source project, written and release on
each version as GNU GPL software. We do believe the right way is to give you 
the power to change, edit and configure whatever you want, both on clients and 
server. Arianne always welcome your contributions and modifications to the code 
to make this the open source reference platform for game content providers.

Arianne is playable.
Arianne now supports three games, a TicTacToe game, a multiplayer Gladiators 
fighting game and a multiplayer Pacman game.
