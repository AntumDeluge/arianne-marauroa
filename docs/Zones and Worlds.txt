Objects must be stored somewhere, and we use Zones now to store them.
A zone is just a container of Objects.

In order to improve the modificability of the Marauroa platform we have
made RPZone to be an interface so that if you want you can implement it
as you think it is more efficient.

The actual Marauroa RP Zone consists of several data structures:
- a HashMap of <RPObject.ID, RPObject> 
- a List of RPObject
- a Perception 

The idea is to have already computed in the Zone the perception so saving
LOTS of time that would be needed to generate it. All the data structures
contains the same objects, but the hashmap is used to fast search of objects
using its RPObject.ID, this is the most usual way for locating the object.
List is used to improve the time requiered to build a total perception. And
well, we used perception to precalculate the delta perception.

Actually the perception is the same for all the players on the Zone, on the 
future we could split the zone into several smaller areas each of them would
have its own perception
