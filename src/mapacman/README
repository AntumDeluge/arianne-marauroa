maPacman
--------
This is a implementation of multiplayer Pacman style game using Arianne 
framework.


Description
-----------
Pac-Man is a maze game where the character Pac-Man, a yellow circle with a mouth, 
has to navigate a maze eating dots and prizes. A level, or board, is finished when
 all dots are eaten. Four monsters, named Shadow (Blinky), Speedy (Pinky), Bashful
 (Inky), and Pokey (Clyde), wander the maze attempting to eat Pac-Man; they are 
red, pink, aqua and orange in color, respectively. (In the original Puck-Man, 
these monsters were named Akabei, Pinky, Aosuke, and Guzuta). Four special dots, 
called energizers or powerpills, near the corners of the maze provide Pac-Man with
 the temporary ability to eat the monsters (all four of which turn a deep blue 
while they are subject to being eaten), who then go back "home" (a box in the 
center of the maze) to regenerate. The amount of time the monsters remain 
vulnerable after the energizers are hit varies from one board to the next, but the
 time period generally trends shorter as the game progresses, and after many boards
 have been completed the monsters will actually not turn blue at all when the 
energizers are contacted. Intermissions between some boards (specifically, between 
Boards 2 and 3, 5 and 6, 9 and 10, and then following every four completed boards
 thereafter) show humorous animated cut-scenes featuring Pac-Man and the monsters. 

Additionally, points can be earned by having Pac-Man run over a symbol that appears
 twice during each board just below the box in the center of the maze from which 
the monsters emerge. The symbols change with each successive one or two boards, and
 their point value steadily increases; a pair of cherries, which is used on the 
first board, is worth only 100 points, while the last symbol to appear, a key, counts 5,000.
