simpleGame
----------

SimpleGame is an implementation of TicTacToe using the Marauroa engine.
The idea is to build a simple game to test the engine and localize black
spots that need to be reworked. Our goal is to increase the complexity
of the development gradually instead of starting developing a very complex
game from the begin.

Tic-Tac-Toe, also called Noughts and Crosses, is a classic game between two
players, "O" and "X", who alternate in marking the spaces in a 3×3 board, 
trying to put three of their own marks in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal 
row. 

For instance, the following game was won by the first player, "X": 


  | |X   O| |X   O| |X   O| |X   O| |X   O| |X   O| |X
 -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-
  | |     | |     | |     |O|     |O|     |O|O    |O|O
 -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-
  | |     | |    X| |    X| |    X| |X   X| |X   X|X|X

The following game was won by the first player, "O": 


  | |     |X|    O|X|    O|X|    O|X|    O|X|    O|X|
 -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-
  |O|     |O|     |O|     |O|    O|O|    O|O|    O|O|O
 -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-   -+-+-
  | |     | |     | |     | |X    | |X   X| |X   X| |X

In a normal 3×3 tic-tac-toe game, both players have a strategy to draw the game. 
In fact, any move by the first player leads to a draw with best play. 

The corner opening has the disadvantage that the centre defense is well-known, 
and in many of the lines that follow, there is only one obvious move by 
respondant which doesn't lead to immediate defeat. Thus such games are easily 
drawn. 

A better strategy might be to open on an edge. In this case, there are four 
responses with which the responder can force a draw - centre, opposite edge, 
or either adjacent corner. The play which follows is often subtler, with scope
 for either player to set traps for the other.

Instruction
-----------
The main goal of the game is to set 3 pieces of our color while avoiding the 
rival to do that.
So to begin play just login and choose your character, and then do a click on
the empty board, you will be presented with a dialog to choose rival, once you
choose it and your rival choose you, you both will start to play the game.

You will be notified when the game finish, and if you won or you lost.


Support
-------
This is the first release of the game, and even in its simplicity, it is a 
complex piece of code, so if you test it and find any kind of problem, please 
drop us a line describing the problem and the output of the application to:
