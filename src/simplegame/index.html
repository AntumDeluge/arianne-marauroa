Zone contains (directly) only characters.

Normal case:
1. After login player gets the  list of characters  in Zone by sending GetCharacterListAction.

2. The server sends the list with all registered characters to player inclusiv
   status information (idle, busy).
   
3. The player chooses one character and sends "challenge" action addressed to
   this character to server
   
4. The Server puts "you have been challenged from X" action in character object.

5. The challenged player answers with "accept challenge" action.

6. The game begins:
6.1 GameBoard object is created and assigned to both characters.
    (f.e. slot "hand" )
6.2 Players are making moves in order (MoveAction).
    to be continued...
