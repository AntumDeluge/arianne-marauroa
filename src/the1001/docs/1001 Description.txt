You are the player, and you OWN several characters, each characters is a 
gladiator. As a gladiator your task is t fight and survive in the Arena.
You can also play as a spectator, and join the arena to see the combat and
decide the luck of the fighters, as spectator you can decide if the looser die
or not and the amount of fame that is assigned to each of the fighters.
Your main goal is to get fame so that you can buy better equipment, and better 
gladiators.

So your task as player is either fight for earn fame or watch fights for 
assigning fame.

Your gladiator can also train other gladiators for exchange of fame.

Appart of fame, each gladiator has a set of attributes and skills. 
Let's see the attributes:
- Strengh
	Determine the hit strengh of the character, the greater the more hard it will
	hit.
- Speed
 	Determine how fast the gladiator is, and this is related with the skill to 
 	defense and attack.
- Size
	Determine how easy is to take down your gladiator, and it is related with 
	Strengh and speed.
- Breath
	Determine how tired you are.	
- Fame
	Determine the value of your gladiator and it is like a change value to adquiere
	new gladiators and equipment.
	
They also have a set of Skills:
- Attack skill
	Determine how good you are at attacking, determine how fast and how hard you hit.
- Defense skill
	Determine how good you are absorbing hits.
- Evasion skill
	Determine your skill to avoid being hitted.
	
With the fame you have earnt you can buy new items and gladiators.
The available items are:
- Helm
- Shield
- Armor	
	They are protection for the head, hit and body respectively
- Weapons
    · Sword
    · Spear
	They are the weapon gladiators use.

You can buy new items and gladiators at "the 1001 Heroes House".
Each one has a price in fame that you must pay.

You can retire your gladiator to "the 1001 Heroes House" and you will also get
extra fame for that.

These are the main objects and actions.
Let's describe now how one game would look like, exactly as Marauroa server would
see it.

Example of a real game
----------------------

We can assume that player did already created a player for play the game.
It it the next player:

Player
  {
  name="Rufus"
  password="zafe pazzword"
  }

So Rufus LOGIN into our Server, and it is granted login with a LOGIN ACK Message.
Just after that server tell Rufus that he is playing "1001 Gladiators" with a SERVER
INFO Message, and it sends Rufus his list of characters. Because the type of game we
are creating Rufus has only one character.

Character
  {
  type="character"
  object_id="1"
  name="Rufus Maximus"
  fame="100"
  
  gladiators
    {
    empty
    }
    
  backpack
    {
    empty
    }
  }
  
Rufus is a wise man and he decide to buy a above standard gladiator with his fame
and just a simple sword. To do that he send a ACTION message to server with the info
he saw at Heroes Shop object in the last perception.

Perception
  {
  Heroes' shop
    {
    type="shop"
    gladiators
      {
      Gladiator
        {
        type="gladiator"
        object_id="1122"
        name="Ragnar"
        rp_strengh="10"
        rp_speed="4"
        rp_size="10"
        rp_breath="10"
        rp_fame="70"
        rp_attack="10"
        rp_defend="10"
        rp_evasion="4"
        rp_health="100"
        num_victory=0
        num_defeat=0  
        }
      Gladiator
        {
        type="gladiator"
        object_id="1242"
        name="Speedy Gonzalez"
        rp_strengh="4"
        rp_speed="10"
        rp_size="5"
        rp_breath="12"
        rp_fame="70"
        rp_attack="6"
        rp_defend="5"
        rp_evasion="14"
        rp_health="100"
        num_victory=0
        num_defeat=0        
        }
      }
    
    items
      {
      Sword
        {
        type="sword"
        object_id="11672"
        rp_attack="7"
        rp_defend="3"
        rp_price="30";
        }
      Shield
        {
        type="shield"
        object_id="11673"
        rp_attack="1"
        rp_defend="10"
        rp_price="70";
        }
      Spear
        {
        type="spear"
        object_id="11674"
        rp_attack="10"
        rp_defend="0"
        rp_price="10";
        }        
      }
    }
  }

We ignored the empty slots for simplicity.
So our mighty Rufus would send the next actions.

Buy
  {
  action_id="1231"
  shop_item="11672"
  }
  
Buy
  {
  action_id="1232"
  shop_item="1122"
  }
  
See the order doesn't matter, as it will be stored into the player.
On the next perception the wise Rufus will have his character as this:

Perception
  {
  Character
    {
    type="character"
    object_id="1"
    name="Rufus Maximus"
    fame="0"
    action_1231="success"
    action_1232="success"
    
    gladiators
      {
      Gladiator
        {
        type="gladiator"
        object_id="1122"
        name="Ragnar"
        rp_strengh="10"
        rp_speed="4"
        rp_size="10"
        rp_breath="10"
        rp_fame="0"
        rp_attack="10"
        rp_defend="10"
        rp_evasion="4"
        rp_health="100"
        num_victory=0
        num_defeat=0      
        }
      }
      
    backpack
      {
      Sword
        {
        type="sword"
        object_id="15672"
        rp_attack="7"
        rp_defend="3"
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
Just a few points to notice:
1) See how the rp_fame of Ragnar dropped from 70 to 0. You guessed it, it is the price.
2) See that sword has a new different Object id.  
3) rp_price was removed from the sword.
4) See that the actions succedded.

Ok, our mighty hero is now at the Arena watching "A-Bush" against "No MDW found".
The combat is a really hard one... see it:

"No MDW found" hits "A-Bush" with a powefull 15 points lose hit!.

Perception (It is delta perception )
  {
  Character
    {
    type="character"
    object_id="3"
    name="Anonymous Player"
    fame="0"
  
    gladiators
      {
      Gladiator
        {
        type="gladiator"
        object_id="1122"
        name="A-Bush"
        rp_strengh="10"
        rp_speed="6"
        rp_size="8"
        rp_breath="9"
        rp_fame="50"
        rp_attack="20"
        rp_defend="20"
        rp_evasion="1"
        rp_health="54"
        num_victory="3"
        num_defeat="1"  
        mode="attack"   
        damaged="15"
        }
      }
    }
  }

And now it is time for "A-Bush" to hit "No MDW found" back. There is no Turns, it
is just casual that one hits after the other, really the concept of turn doesn't
exist.

Perception (It is delta perception )
  {
  Character
    {
    type="character"
    object_id="3"
    name="Anonymous Player"
    fame="0"
  
    gladiators
      {
      Gladiator
        {
        type="gladiator"
        object_id="1122"
        name="A-Bush"
        rp_strengh="10"
        rp_speed="6"
        rp_size="8"
        rp_breath="9"
        rp_fame="50"
        rp_attack="20"
        rp_defend="20"
        rp_evasion="1"
        rp_health="54"
        num_victory="3"
        num_defeat="1"  
        mode="attack"   
        }
      }
    }
    
  Character
    {
    type="character"
    object_id="3"
    name="Another Anonymous Player"
    fame="0"
  
    gladiators
      {
      Gladiator
        {
        type="gladiator"
        object_id="1123"
        name="No MDW found"
        rp_strengh="3"
        rp_speed="4"
        rp_size="3"
        rp_breath="2"
        rp_fame="20"
        rp_attack="7"
        rp_defend="2"
        rp_evasion="4"
        rp_health="0"
        num_victory="0"
        num_defeat="1"  
        mode="dogde"   
        damage="37"
        }
      }
    }
  }

See it has reduced health on "No MDW found" to 0. So the combat ends and it is now
turn for the spectators to issue a score. To do that we create a new object that 
will gather the scores:

ArenaScore
  {
  turns="100"
  winner_id="1122"
  losser_id="1123"
  fame_winner="100"
  fame_losser="0"
  number_electors="0"
  }

Here is the turn of our player "Rufus" to issue the score. So he sends a ACTION
that is a AwardFame

AwardFame
  {
  action_id="12131"
  fame_winner="30"
  fame_losser="70"
  }
  
So on the next perception we will have:

Perception
  {
  Character
    {
    type="character"
    object_id="1"
    name="Rufus Maximus"
    fame="0"
    action_12131="success"
    fame_awarded=""
    
    gladiators
      {
      Gladiator
        {
        type="gladiator"
        object_id="1122"
        name="Ragnar"
        rp_strengh="10"
        rp_speed="4"
        rp_size="10"
        rp_breath="10"
        rp_fame="0"
        rp_attack="10"
        rp_defend="10"
        rp_evasion="4"
        rp_health="100"
        num_victory=0
        num_defeat=0      
        }
      }
      
    backpack
      {
      Sword
        {
        type="sword"
        object_id="15672"
        rp_attack="7"
        rp_defend="3"
        }
      }
    }

  ArenaScore
    {
    turns="99"
    winner_id="1122"
    losser_id="1123"
    fame_winner="30"
    fame_losser="70"
    number_electors="1"
    }
  }

Nothing more happens, but turns MUST elapse before a new step is taken.
Then when turns elapses, players are granted fame.

        rp_attack="7"
        rp_defend="3"
        }
      }
  }

Observe that num_victory and num_defeat is changed accordinly the same that
fame. Note also that characters are not healthed, they will health alone
after a number of turns.
  
Now our mighty Rufus is going to fight against any brave gladiator, so he
request a fight.  

Fight
  {
  action_id="2393";
  }
  
And again in the next perception we will have:

Perception
  {
  Character
    {
    type="character"
    object_id="1"
    name="Rufus Maximus"
    fame="0"

        num_victory=0
        num_defeat=0      
        wanna_fight=""
        }
      }
      
    backpack
      {
      Sword
        {

        object_id="15672"
        rp_attack="7"
        rp_defend="3"
        }
      }
  }

TODO: Explain how "A-Bush" accept the fight and fight against rufus...
